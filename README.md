## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- PostgreSQL 12+ (or Docker)
- OpenAI API key with available credits

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate it (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: Verify packages are installed:
```bash
pip list | grep -E "dotenv|agno|psycopg|openai"
```

### 3. Set Up PostgreSQL Database

**Option A: Local PostgreSQL**
```bash
createdb crm_db_rag
```

**Option B: Docker PostgreSQL**
```bash
# If using Docker, create the database in your running container
docker exec -it <container_name> createdb -U <postgres_user> crm_db_rag

# Example:
docker exec -it crm_postgres createdb -U crm_user crm_db_rag
```

### 4. Configure Environment

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your database and API credentials:

```bash
DB_USER=crm_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=crm_db_rag
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

### 5. Initialize Database Schema

Run the setup script to create tables and insert sample data:

```bash
python setup_db.py
```

This will:
- Create the `leads` table
- Insert 30 sample leads
- Create indexes for performance
- Display a summary of your data

### 6. (Optional) Setup Security Features

If you want to use the secure app with authentication, run the security schema:

```bash
cat security_schema.sql | docker exec -i crm_postgres psql -U crm_user -d crm_db_rag
```

This adds:
- User accounts with roles
- Lead assignments
- Audit logging tables
- Permission controls

### 7. Run the Application

**Choose your version:**

#### Option A: Standard App (No Security)
```bash
venv/bin/streamlit run app.py
```
- No login required
- All data visible to everyone
- No access control
- Best for: Personal use, demos, development

#### Option B: Secure App (With Security) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
```bash
venv/bin/streamlit run app_secure.py
```
- Login required
- Role-based access control
- Row-level security (users see only their leads)
- Column-level security (sensitive data protected)
- Audit logging
- Best for: Production, team use, compliance

The app will open at `http://localhost:8501`

## 💬 Example Queries

### Standard App Queries
Try these natural language queries:

### Basic Queries
- "Show me 10 latest leads"
- "How many total leads do we have?"
- "Show me all new leads"

### Filtering
- "Leads from company Google"
- "Show me leads with status 'qualified'"
- "Leads from website source"

### Analytics
- "How many leads by status?"
- "Leads by source"
- "What's the total value of all leads?"
- "Average value by status"

### Time-based
- "New leads this week"
- "Leads created in the last 24 hours"
- "Show me leads from yesterday"

### Sorting
- "Show me leads sorted by value (highest first)"
- "Latest 5 leads ordered by creation date"

### Secure App Queries (app_secure.py)

**For Admins:**
- "Show me all leads" → Returns all 30 leads with all columns
- "What's our total pipeline value?" → Shows deal values

**For Sales Reps:**
- "Show me my leads" → Returns only 5-9 assigned leads
- "What's my pipeline value?" → No results (value hidden)

**Notice:** All queries are automatically filtered based on user role!

## 🔐 Security & User Roles

### User Roles and Permissions

| Role | Can See All Leads | Can See Value | Can Export | Description |
|------|------------------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| **admin** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Full system access, view audit logs |
| **manager** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Team data, internal notes hidden |
| **sales_rep** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | Only assigned leads, no sensitive data |
| **viewer** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | Read-only access to assigned leads |

### Demo Accounts (Secure App)

| Username | Password | Role | Access | Assigned Leads |
|----------|----------|------|--------|----------------|
| `admin` | *(any)* | Administrator | All 29 leads, all data including value | All 29 leads |
| `manager` | *(any)* | Manager | All 29 leads, no internal notes | All 29 leads |
| `sales` | *(any)* | Sales Rep | Only 16 assigned leads, no value column | 16 leads |
| `viewer` | *(any)* | Viewer | Read-only, assigned leads only | 5-9 leads |

**Note:** For demo purposes, any password will work. In production, implement proper password authentication.

### Testing Security

1. **Login as different users** to see how the UI adapts
2. **Run the same query** as admin vs sales rep - different results!
3. **Check audit logs** - login as admin to see who accessed what
4. **Try security boundaries** - sales rep can't see deal values
5. **Test specific queries** - "Show me Diana Baker" works differently per role

Quick security test:
```bash
python test_security.py
```

**Comprehensive Testing:** For detailed testing instructions, see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) which includes:
- Pre-test setup
- Testing all user roles
- Security feature verification
- SQL query testing
- UI component testing
- Real-world scenarios
- Troubleshooting tests

### Query Examples by Role

**Admin/Manager Queries:**
- "Show me all leads" → Returns all 29 leads
- "Show me lead named Diana Baker" → Finds Diana with full details
- "Leads from Cloudify" → Returns Cloudify leads with value column
- "What's our total pipeline value?" → Shows sum of all deal values

**Sales Rep/Viewer Queries:**
- "Show me my leads" → Returns only your 16 assigned leads
- "Show me lead named Diana Baker" → Returns "Not assigned to you" (if not assigned)
- "Leads by status" → Shows count of YOUR leads by status
- "What's my pipeline value?" → Value column hidden, can't see totals

**Important:** Non-admins can only see leads specifically assigned to them!

## 🔍 How It Works

### Standard App (app.py)
1. **Natural Language Processing** - User types query in plain English
2. **SQL Generation** - Agent uses function calling to generate appropriate SQL
3. **Query Execution** - SQL is executed against PostgreSQL database
4. **Results Display** - Formatted results shown to user

### Secure App (app_secure.py)
1. **Authentication** - User logs in with credentials
2. **Permission Check** - System determines user's role and access level
3. **Natural Language Processing** - User types query
4. **SQL Generation** - Agent generates SQL
5. **Query Sanitization** - Query automatically modified:
   - Row filtering: Add WHERE for assigned leads only
   - Column filtering: Remove sensitive columns (value, notes)
6. **Query Execution** - Execute sanitized query
7. **Audit Logging** - Log access to audit_logs table
8. **Results Display** - Show filtered results with security notice

## 🆚 App Comparison

| Feature | app.py (Standard) | app_secure.py (Secure) |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Login Required** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Authentication** | ❌ None | ✅ Username/password |
| **Row-Level Security** | ❌ No | ✅ Users see only their leads |
| **Column-Level Security** | ❌ No | ✅ Sensitive data hidden |
| **Audit Logging** | ❌ No | ✅ All queries tracked |
| **Role-Based UI** | ❌ No | ✅ UI adapts to role |
| **User Sessions** | ❌ No | ✅ Session management |
| **Best For** | Development, demos | Production, teams |

### Example: Same Query, Different Results

**Query:** "Show me all leads"

**Admin User (app_secure.py):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM leads
-- Returns: 30 rows with all columns including value
```

**Sales Rep User (app_secure.py):**
```sql
SELECT id, name, email, phone, company, title, status, source, notes, created_at
FROM leads
WHERE (id IN (SELECT lead_id FROM lead_assignments WHERE user_id = 3) OR owner_id = 3)
-- Returns: 5-9 rows only, NO value column
```

**Standard App (app.py):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM leads
-- Returns: 30 rows with all columns (anyone can see everything)
```

## 🎯 Key Components

### CRMDatabaseTools (`crm_agent.py`)
Custom toolkit with security features:

1. **execute_sql**: Execute SQL queries (with automatic sanitization)
2. **get_table_schema**: Get table structure
3. **get_column_info**: Get column details with sample data
4. **my_leads**: Show current user's assigned leads
5. **team_leads**: Show team leads (managers+ only)

### AuthService (`auth.py`)
Authentication and authorization:

1. **authenticate_user()**: Validate credentials and return user object
2. **sanitize_query()**: Modify queries based on user permissions
3. **get_accessible_leads_query()**: Generate WHERE clause for row filtering
4. **get_hidden_columns()**: Determine which columns to hide
5. **log_access()**: Log all data access to audit table

### CRM Agent (`app.py` / `app_secure.py`)
Agno Agent configured with:
- System message for CRM context
- CRMDatabaseTools for database access
- OpenAI GPT-4o for intelligence
- Markdown output formatting
- **(Secure app only)**: User context and permissions

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` file** to version control
2. **Use strong passwords** for PostgreSQL and user accounts
3. **Limit database user permissions** to only necessary operations
4. **Use environment variables** for sensitive data
5. **Enable HTTPS** in production
6. **Implement rate limiting** for login attempts
7. **Use the secure app** (app_secure.py) for production deployments
8. **Review audit logs** regularly to monitor access patterns

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Option 1: Streamlit Cloud
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect to Streamlit Cloud
3. Add environment variables in deployment settings
4. Deploy!

### Option 2: Docker
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port=8501"]
```

### Option 3: Traditional Hosting
- Use Gunicorn + Nginx
- Set up systemd service
- Configure SSL with Let's Encrypt

## 🤝 Adapting for Your CRM

### Using Your Own Database

1. Update the schema in `schema.sql` with your actual table structure
2. Modify the system message in `app.py` to match your schema
3. Update example queries in the sidebar
4. Re-run `setup_db.py` or use your existing data

### Connecting to Existing CRM

Replace the sample data with a connection to your existing CRM:

```python
# In db_connection.py, modify the connection
connection_string = f"postgresql://{user}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{your_crm_db}"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**1. ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dotenv'**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Verify packages are installed
pip list | grep -E "dotenv|agno|openai"

# If missing, reinstall:
pip install python-dotenv agno openai psycopg2-binary sqlalchemy

# Always use venv's streamlit:
venv/bin/streamlit run app.py
```

**2. PostgreSQL connection errors**
```bash
# If using Docker:
docker exec -it crm_postgres psql -U crm_user -d crm_db_rag -c "SELECT 1"

# Check container is running:
docker ps | grep postgres

# Test database exists:
docker exec crm_postgres psql -U crm_user -d postgres -c "\l" | grep crm_db_rag
```

**3. TypeError with agno Toolkit**
- Ensure you have the correct agno version (2.4.7)
- Check that `crm_agent.py` doesn't use unsupported parameters

**4. UnhashableParamError in Streamlit**
- Fixed by using underscore prefix for unhashable parameters
- Make sure your code uses `_db_connection` in cached functions

**5. Can't see database in DBeaver**
- Click "Refresh" on the database connection
- Ensure you're connected with the right user (crm_user, not postgres)
- Check connection settings match your `.env` file

**6. "Invalid username or password" on login**
- Use simple usernames: `admin`, `manager`, `sales`, `viewer`
- Password can be anything for demo mode
- Check that users exist: `docker exec crm_postgres psql -U crm_user -d crm_db_rag -c "SELECT username FROM users;"`

**7. Agent says "no leads assigned to you"**
- If you're admin/manager, you should see all leads
- If you're sales/viewer, you need leads assigned to you
- Check assignments: `docker exec crm_postgres psql -U crm_user -d crm_db_rag -c "SELECT u.username, COUNT(*) FROM lead_assignments la JOIN users u ON la.user_id = u.id GROUP BY u.username;"`

**8. SQL syntax errors in query execution**
- Fixed in latest version - query sanitization now properly wraps WHERE clauses
- Ensure you're using the updated `auth.py` and `crm_agent.py`
- Restart the Streamlit app after pulling latest changes

**9. Agent can't find specific leads (e.g., Diana Baker)**
- For admin: Use queries like "Show me lead named Diana Baker"
- For sales/viewer: Can only search YOUR assigned leads
- The my_leads tool now correctly shows all leads for admin/managers

**10. SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted f-string**
- Fixed in latest version - missing closing quotes added
- Ensure you have the latest `app_secure.py`
- Restart the Streamlit app

**11. Search button doesn't respond on first click**
- Fixed in latest version - now uses form-based approach for better state management
- If you experience issues, click the Search button directly (Cmd+Enter not supported in forms)
- The button should work on the first click now

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Test PostgreSQL connection
psql -U crm_user -d crm_db_rag -h localhost

# For Docker:
docker exec -it crm_postgres psql -U crm_user -d crm_db_rag

# Check if PostgreSQL is running
pg_isready

# View PostgreSQL logs (local install)
tail -f /usr/local/var/postgres/logfile
```

### Python Issues
```bash
# Verify virtual environment is active
which python  # Should show venv/bin/python

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall

# Check Python version (requires 3.10+)
python --version
```

### Application Issues
- Check the terminal for detailed error messages
- Verify all environment variables are set in `.env`
- Ensure OpenAI API key has credits
- Check database has the `leads` table: `psql -U crm_user -d crm_db_rag -c "\dt"`
- Make sure to use `venv/bin/streamlit run app.py` (not just `streamlit run app.py`)
